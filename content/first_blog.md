```shell
git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git
```
then you can choose a theme you like on this website: [Pelican Themes](https://pelicanthemes.com/)

I like minimalism style, so i choose this [martin-pelican](https://pelicanthemes.com/martin-pelican/) theme.

pelican-themes -U martin-pelican // use this command to make the new theme take effective
```
after install the theme, we need enter our blog project
```shell
cd ganchuanman.github.io/
```
you can see pelicanconf.py file in your project root path, add a new line in the file:
```python
THEME = "martin-pelican"
```
then re-generate the website with your new theme:
```shell
pelican content
```
use this command to preview your blog content on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```shell
pelican --listen
```

## 3.Write your first blog:
our blog content was written with markdown in content folder:
```shell
